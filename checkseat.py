# Here you will buy 9 adult tickets for the performance of Størst av alt er kjærligheten on 3
# February, where there are 9 tickets available and where the seats are in the same row. The
# chairs do not have to be next to each other. We want to get a total of what it costs to buy
# these tickets, but you don't need to take the payment itself into account, we assume it
# happens on another system that you don't need to create. This function will be implemented
# in Python and SQL.
